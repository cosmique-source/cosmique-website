Most music servers treat your library as a flat collection of files. They don't understand that your 1975 original pressing sounds different from your 2015 Mobile Fidelity remaster. They can't tell the difference between Beethoven's Symphony No. 5 conducted by Karajan versus Furtwängler. Orbit does.",
